Once upon a time, there was a a techie guy that wanted to learn to write computer code.  He decided to enroll in a course to learn how to write code, and make himself more  attractive to prospective employers, and and so he would never have to get screamed at by unreasonable retail customers on Christmas ever again.  During this educational experience, he was given an assignment to write a short story.  "What do I know about writing a story?" he thought to himself.  Sitting back at his workspace, he pondered his options.

"I could write a short adventure story, I suppose...or maybe something with a moral?"  He thought about how his wife, who was a college educated writer and self published fantasy novelist handles her writing.  "She usually has an ending in mind before she starts, and works toward that.  English never was my strong suit" he thought to himself.

While thinking about what to write about, he decided to complete the rest of his assignments first, which were completed with relative ease.  Once those were out of the way, he realized that even though he still hadn't really figured out his story idea, he had still finished writing the story.  Odd how that works.

The group still had to vote on the best story.  Despite not putting much effort into the story, nor having much content, his story was still chosen as the best, much to his disappointment.  If he wanted to go into creative writing, he would have gone to a liberal arts college.

So he then went into notepad and started typing away, line after line he typed away until he finally managed to complete his story to then show off to the rest of the group!

CARLOS ADDED THIS  BELOW:
This is the first file test for Test repository.

  Once upon a time I was a Software Engineer and then I was not. Like a frog being slowly warmed in a pot of water to the point of boiling and not even noticing.  It happends in many aspects of like. 

  Life happends and it should not be. The world moves by inputs a waves of the world collective. All inclusive of people, plants, animals and cosmic rays.

  They all are continuosly notching you in all directions. But never forget that you are in the driver seat. Corrections must be made all the time to stay focused on what you want from live. Stear all the time with purpose. Otherwise you will end up being a frog but a boiled frog.  Not very usefull as a frog anymore other than for a quick snack.

Sincerely
Carlos E Rodriguez.  (the frog that jumped out of the hot water before it killed me)
